## 🧮 Grading Distribution

| Component | Weight | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| **Quantum Computation Labs (6 Labs)** | **60%** | Practical exercises conducted in Google Colab using Qiskit and other quantum frameworks. Each lab emphasizes coding, visualization, and theoretical explanation. |
| **Coursera Module Completion** | **40%** | Successful completion of the Coursera course **“Exploring Quantum Computation with Qiskit”**, including quizzes and assignments. |

**Total Course Grade = 60% (Labs) + 40% (Coursera) = 100%**

## ⚙️ Quantum Computation Labs — 60%

These six labs are designed to reinforce conceptual understanding through hands-on practice in **quantum circuit simulation**, **Qiskit programming**, and **theoretical application**.

### 🔹 Key Learning Outcomes
- Construct and simulate quantum circuits using Qiskit.
- Interpret Bloch sphere representations and probability distributions.
- Analyze algorithms such as Quantum Adder and Quantum Fourier Transform.
- Document findings and code in well-structured Google Colab notebooks.

### 🧾 Grading per Lab
Each lab carries **10% of the total course grade**, broken down as:
- **3%** — Lab Report (Colab Notebook)
- **3%** — Live Checkpoint / Demonstration
- **4%** — Quiz on Theory and Circuit Concepts

Refer to the **[Quantum Lab Grading Criteria](./Quantum_Lab_Grading_Criteria_README.md)** for detailed assessment guidelines.
