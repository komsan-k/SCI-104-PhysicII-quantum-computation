# ‚öõÔ∏è Quantum Computation Lab Grading Criteria (10% Per Lab)

This grading framework is designed for **six Quantum Computation Labs** conducted in a **Google Colab** environment.  
Each lab carries a total weight of **10%**, distributed as follows:

| Component | Weight | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| **Lab Report** | 3% | Final documentation, code outputs, and written analysis. |
| **Check Point** | 3% | Live execution and verification of circuits during the lab session. |
| **Quiz** | 4% | Conceptual and theoretical understanding of quantum algorithms. |

**Total Lab Grade = 3% (Report) + 3% (Check Point) + 4% (Quiz) = 10%**

## üßæ 1. Lab Report (3%) ‚Äî Focus: Colab Documentation

The **Google Colab Notebook** itself serves as the final lab report.  
Evaluation is based on documentation clarity, technical execution, and analysis depth.

| Criterion | Relevance to Quantum Labs | Focus Points |
|------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| **Code Completion & Execution** | All required Qiskit/Cirq cells (imports, circuit definitions, measurements) must execute successfully. | No syntax errors; clean, reproducible code. |
| **Visualization & Analysis** | Accurate display and labeling of outputs (e.g., Bloch Sphere plots, histograms). | Correct interpretation of results such as probability amplitudes or circuit outcomes. |
| **Written Explanations** | Markdown commentary must clearly explain the mathematical or conceptual steps performed. | Concise descriptions of operations (e.g., effect of Hadamard gate, Quantum Adder logic). |

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Check Point (3%) ‚Äî Focus: Live Simulation & Implementation

This component evaluates **real-time circuit execution** and the student‚Äôs ability to troubleshoot and verify their code during lab sessions.

| Criterion | Relevance to Quantum Labs | Focus Points |
|------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| **Circuit Implementation** | Independent construction of assigned quantum circuits (e.g., Controlled-Z, 3-qubit QFT). | Correct gate selection, register assignment, and sequence order. |
| **State Vector Verification** | Demonstration of intermediate or final state vectors, as applicable. | Correctness of amplitudes and expected quantum states. |
| **Troubleshooting & Debugging** | Ability to resolve code or logic errors during the live check. | Efficient identification and correction of syntax or conceptual issues. |

## üß† 3. Lab Quiz (4%) ‚Äî Focus: Theory & Conceptual Understanding

Each lab concludes with a short quiz assessing pre-lab and post-lab theoretical knowledge.

| Lab | Focus | Sample Topics |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **Lab 1: Introduction to Qubits & Bloch Sphere** | Representing qubit states and Bloch Sphere visualization. |
| **Lab 2: Quantum Gates** | Matrix forms of X, H, and T gates; the effect of CNOT on entanglement. |
| **Lab 3: Superposition & Measurement** | Probability collapse, basis measurement, and randomness verification. |
| **Lab 4: Entanglement & Bell States** | Correlation between entangled qubits and violation of classical expectations. |
| **Lab 5: Quantum Adders** | Role of ancilla qubits and advantages over classical adders. |
| **Lab 6: Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)** | Differences between QFT and DFT, and the role of phase gates. |

## üìä Summary of Grading Emphasis

| Component | Purpose | Assessment Emphasis |
|------------|----------|--------------------|
| **Lab Report** | Written & Computational Accuracy | Clarity, reproducibility, correctness |
| **Check Point** | Real-Time Implementation | Problem-solving, correctness, responsiveness |
| **Quiz** | Theoretical Understanding | Conceptual depth, mathematical foundation |

## üß© Evaluation Philosophy

This grading system balances:
- **Hands-on quantum coding** (practical mastery through simulation),
- **Conceptual understanding** (quantum logic and circuit theory),
- **Clear communication** (via Colab reports and structured markdown analysis).

Students are encouraged to maintain **reproducible, well-documented notebooks** that demonstrate both theoretical insight and technical fluency.
